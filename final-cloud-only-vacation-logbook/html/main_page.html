      <p class="lead">
        Whether it's going to be Summer or Winter, it's time to start planning
        your vacation! Our vacation logbook is here to help you with that. Powered
         by Google Places, you'll be able to search up places to go and things to
         do in no time, and save lists of such places so that you don't forget them!
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: this is primararily a server backend that serves the APIs for your account.
         Authenticating below creates a unique account in our database, and
         redirects you to a simple frontend that shows a list of places you've added
         associated with your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use our APIs in order to add Places to User Accounts. A frontend
        application is not being served by this backend at this time.
